IOTA v1.3.003 - tweaks and bugfixes


BUGFIXES:
    - Replaced a .exists check for new output subfolders with a try block to
      handle concurrency problems
    - Fixed bug that arises upon an attempt to update a non-existent dictionary
      entry in runtime analysis
    - Input path(s) provided in command line when launching GUI are populated in
      the input widget
    - Fixed Live PRIME key error

TWEAKS:
    - GUI attempts to reconstruct initial input folder paths from args
     (automatically globbed by argparse)
    - If > 10 input paths, input is written into a list file, which is then used
      as then input path.
