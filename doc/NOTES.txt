IOTA v1.1.019 - clustering bugfix

1. Fixed bug where clustering results from previous runs were retained if new
runs were launched without quitting IOTA. Now, this does not happen.
2. Also adjusted a couple of defaults for integration.mosaic
    a. refinement_target=LSQ *ML
    b. enable_rotational_target_highsym=True
