IOTA v1.1.026 - interface updates

Bugfixes:

1. Added more descriptive error message ("No reflections left after outliers
are removed") to outlier_detection.py
2. Image tracker: went to update by timer; interface works smoother
3. More sophisticated filter for file-finding; can now filter by any keyword

Features:

1. Added function to write out list of inspected images to file (user can now
pick out images to process from a large dataset via inspection)


Known issues:

1. Cropping / padding for Labelit fails if beamX > beamY (why?!)
2. Image tracker: interface could use to be faster w/ large datasets
