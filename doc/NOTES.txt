IOTA v1.1.028 - GUI updates

Bugfixes:
1. Tracker: changed GridBagSizer to SplitterWindow for chart / image list, which
 now sizes correctly at all times (and is adjustable)


Features:
1. Tracker: Selection / Zoom now switched by toolbar toggle buttons
2. Tracker: Removed spotfinding options button / dialog
3. Tracker: Added settings toolbar button / dialog
4. Removed "select only" mode in IOTA GUI (Xterm only now)
5. Streamlined imageset compilation in IOTA GUI
6. Added total image number to input window
7. Sped up logging (esp. on recovery) by importing chunks of text vs. by line
8. Option for "settings only" recovery of past runs
9. Removed beam XY graph from live charts (too slow!)
10. Replaced beam XY graph with hkl slice graph (can toggle between 0kl, h0l,
and hk0), which is much faster and more informative.
11. Changed how unit cell histograms are drawn - slightly faster, but also
potentially more configurable in future
12. Can now read runs from XTerm IOTA into GUI
13. IOTA GUI now takes command arguments; any IOTA PHIL entry can be used as a
command-line argument, and will be automatically interpreted.
14. Tracker GUI now takes command arguments; few now, but more can be added


Known issues:

1. Image tracker: interface could use to be faster w/ large datasets
2. Some IOTA modules are still too slow, esp. for remote operation:
    a. Graphing is still too clunky (requires too much redrawing)
    b. Unit cell clustering takes forever with large datasets
    c. If running via XDisplay, the GUI might semi-freeze at times (though it's
    much better than it was)
    d. There's a weird bug that affects only synthetic images
