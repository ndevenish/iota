IOTA v1.0.002 - GUI additions

New Features
1. Resizable processing output window with tabs for Log and Charts
2. Real-time charts of
    a. Resolution per integrated image
    b. Number of strong reflections per integrated image
3. Internal passing of integration results (and info update) via parallel_map callback function

Known Issues:
1. Still a little dodgy when running IOTA with DIALS; will be improved in future
2. More visuals in the works.
3. Error handling needs to improve (hardly any now)
4. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
5. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that this is woefully inadequate
