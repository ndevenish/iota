IOTA v1.4.015 - bugfixes

- fixed output path structure bug (integrated files, logs, etc. no longer
  include pre-pended absolute path)
- input list is now sorted by filename (and then by image index if a multi-image
  file)
- stdout capture no longer returns a "'unicode' does not have the buffer
  interface" TypeError
- fixed plotting to account for an extra parameter (image index) when
  calculating stats
- add picture file extensions (e.g. png, tiff, etc.) to image file tests
