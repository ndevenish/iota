IOTA v1.1.025 - interface updates

1. PHIL script hidden, showable if user wants to modify
2. Basic/Advanced/Developer - level options (This is in lieu of any auto-PHIL
dialogs; it seems like it might be wiser to wait until we switch to PyQt.)
3. Option widgets for target params (inserted during processing):
    a. target_cell, known_setting, target_cell_centring_type for Labelit
    b. unit_cell, space_group for DIALS
    c. Resolution limits for Labelit
    d. Turn FFT3D on/off for DIALS
    e. These are new settings in IOTA param files, too
4. BUGFIX: Log displayed when run is recovered
5. Searchable log in IOTA GUI
6. LSF queue jobs now abort cleanly (via 'bkill' command)
7. IOTA opens at mouse position
8. Added run number in recovery dialog
9. Recovery dialog sized to content
10. Added significance filter to DIALS options
11. Summary chart now clickable (double-click to view corresponding images)

MORE BUGFIXES:

1. Eliminated iCCP warning by removing the offending iCCP chunk from many (not
all) icons, both Crystal and custom using ImageMagick (NOT COMMITTED YET):
     mogrify -strip <filename>
2. Fixed errors in PHIL handling for DIALS and Labelit option dialogs
3. Corrected target param panel parentage for DIALS options dialog
4. Expert level drop-down choice is now set to Basic if running on Linux
5. Tweaked Recovery option to accept new settings if missing in old PHIL
6. Fixed PRIME input auto-create, which caused a mysterious 'zero reflections'
error (merge.d_max was set to high-res rather than low-res)
7. IOTA actually won't look for new images if monitor mode is off
8. Hidden files (as in '.filename') are not accepted into a list of images
9. Fixed silent bug in TableCtrl
10. Fixed processing summary chart "cut off" at the bottom (on Linux)
11. Fixed monitor mode when no new images found (now keeps waiting w/o timeout)
12. Fixed DIALS triage - now has same modified settings as Processor
13. Input search avoids Nonetype paths
14. LSF queue abort exits cleanly if job has not yet been submitted
15. Input search scrubs "_tmp*" image files
16. Chart picking now shows the correct image associated with plotted data
17. Gain automatically set in cctbx.xfel processing
18. XTerm IOTA correctly sets output path in auto mode
19. XTerm IOTA correctly inteprets centering_type and lattice_type if None

PRIME BUGFIXES

1. Preferences dialog resizes automatically
2. Queue options not blanked when Advanced Options opened
