IOTA v1.0.005 - Changes to command-line module

Bug Fixes:
1. No longer crashes in AUTO mode w/o target file supplied

New Features
1. Streamlined and cleaned upcommand-line module (iota_run.py)
2. Improved progress bar more clearly indicates progress

Known Issues:
1. Still a little dodgy when running IOTA with DIALS; will be improved in future
2. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
3. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that
this is woefully inadequate
4. Sometimes (rarely) hangs when importing a script and changing processing
options - trying to reproduce
