IOTA v1.0.004 - GUI additions & bug fixes

Bug Fixes:
1. Added dispatcher directives to prevent IOTA from crashing on Mac
2. Abort no longer produces "no attribute named 'final'" error
3. Beam XY chart redrawn properly & has equal aspect ratio

New Features
1. Moved all GUI modules into iota_gui_init.py
2. Status box in the output window


Known Issues:
1. Still a little dodgy when running IOTA with DIALS; will be improved in future
2. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
3. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that
this is woefully inadequate
4. Sometimes (rarely) hangs when importing a script and changing processing
options - trying to reproduce
