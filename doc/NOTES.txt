IOTA v1.2.008 - generalized image handling

- New classes:
    - SingleImage base class: carries just the IOTA-related info and a dxtbx
    datablock where appropriate
    - Importer base class: creates a datablock from image (or creates an image
    pickle for HA14, with required modifications), instantiates the SingleImage
    objects, and populates it with image-specific information (beamXY, gain,
    paths, etc.)
    - SingleImage, Importer, and Integrator are subclassed from base classes
    depending on backend
