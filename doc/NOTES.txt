IOTA v1.1.025 - interface updates

1. PHIL script hidden, showable if user wants to modify
2. Basic/Advanced/Developer - level options (This is in lieu of any auto-PHIL
dialogs; it seems like it might be wiser to wait until we switch to PyQt.)
3. Option widgets for target params (inserted during processing):
    a. target_cell, known_setting, target_cell_centring_type for Labelit
    b. unit_cell, space_group for DIALS
    c. Resolution limits for Labelit
    d. Turn FFT3D on/off for DIALS
    e. These are new settings in IOTA param files, too
4. BUGFIX: Log displayed when run is recovered
5. Searchable log in IOTA GUI
