IOTA v1.0.003 - GUI additions & bug fixes

New Features
1. Better error handling (i.e. actual error handling in a few cases)
2. GUI prompts for generating default cctbx / DIALS settings if none are given
3. Image import, pre-processing and integration now happens in one step, per image (GUI only)
4. Progress tracked / charts updated via timed polling rather than at process callback
5. New charts updated in real-time:
    a. beam center coordinate chart
    b. summary pie chart (keeps track of images that failed triage, weren't integrated, etc.)

Known Issues:
1. Still a little dodgy when running IOTA with DIALS; will be improved in future
2. More visuals in the works.
3. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
4. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that this is woefully inadequate
5. Sometimes (rarely) hangs when importing a script and changing processing options - trying to reproduce
6. Odd behavior of status bar when Abort button is pressed
