IOTA v1.1.010 - DIALS additions, run recovery and assorted bugfixes

1. Absorb the wx.PostEvent error if run is aborted
2. Call dials.estimate_gain on image import (had cribbed code before)
3. Option to estimate gain for each image in DIALS options dialog
4. Changing BeamXY and distance propagates them to DIALS PHIL, image is never
 converted to pickle if using DIALS
5. Added detector override to DIALS PHIL defaults
6. iter.cfg and init.cfg now saved for each integration run rather than in
the roof data processing folder
7. Added option to "re-run" previous runs; finished runs can be repeated as
new runs; aborted runs can be restarted and finished (within same run folder)
