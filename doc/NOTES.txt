IOTA v1.2.009 - wxPython 4 compatibility

- Created a iota_ui_base module for base Frames, Windows, etc. (idea is to use
base classes for a wxPython version check)
- Separate iota_plotter module (for plots in separate window instead of PyPlot,
which doesn't work well with wxPython 4 in Matplotlib 2.0; will later become a
module with base plot classes)
- Clunky so far, will update with a more general approach later
