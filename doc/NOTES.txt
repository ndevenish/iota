IOTA v1.2.003 - UI update

Bugfixes:
  - Workaround for images with unrecognizable filename templates; deprecated as
    soon as dxtbx fix is accepted.
  - Updated lists of space groups per lattice type
  - Added failed imports to 'failed triage' fail type
  - Added exception handling for failed PRIME merges at IOTA runtime
  - Fixed input list expansion for Monitor Mode
  - Added more exception handling for image object loading / reading in
  - Unicode-to-str conversion for all input filenames prior to processing
    (apparently causes problems with indexing)
  - Removed duplicate Capturing class from iota_input.py

Features:
  - 'Run Analysis' button in Analysis Tab allows to re-run analysis when timers
     have been stopped (i.e. when run is done / interrupted / recovered)
  - User-supplied sg / uc info overrides that determined by Cluster at runtime
  - PRIME: added timeout to in-IOTA instance (gets stuck if on LCLS queue)
  - Moved image search thread instantiation to separate function
  - Processing thread launches image search when finished (may need to revisit)
  - (In progress) New thread for all calculations; UI will only plot
  - PRIME: Added accepted/rejected images info in UI table
