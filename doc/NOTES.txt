IOTA v1.4.012 - HDF5 handling

- IOTA now reads HDF5 format
    - each HDF5 file is expanded into individual imagesets, which are then
      converted into separate ExperimentList objects (that's the hack for now)
    - internal changes on result tracking so that HDF5 datasets can be handled
      the same as one-image files
    - NOTE: h5py has to be imported only where needed; importing it in a module
      that itself is imported elsewhere seems to cause malloc errors.

- Bugfixes:
    - XTerm IOTA now accumulates "unplotted" results, which can then be plotted
      when the run is recovered in GUI

- Known issues:
    - Comma-delimited file lists aren't read in properly
