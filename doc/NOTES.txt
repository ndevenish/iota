IOTA v1.1.005 - Input handling update

1. A new, faster input processing module for use in both GUI and Xterm versions
2. New much faster file type identification
3. Mac OS X bugfixes:
    a. Moved calling of image viewer to separate thread (dialog allowing user
     to select number of images to view would hang otherwise)
    b. When exiting app, threads continued to run; now (mostly) fixed
4. Wildcard handling in XTerm IOTA input
