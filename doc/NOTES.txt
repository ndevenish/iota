IOTA v1.1.031 - HKL slice viewer

Bugfixes:


Features:
- The HKL slice viewer (a part of "charts" tab) can now be set to show the
general completeness for any space / point group
- The chart tab has been reorganized for potential insertion of other widgets
for each of the chart panels; this has the side effect of improving the
presentation of the HKL slice viewer.

Known issues:
