IOTA v1.2.001 - UI update

Bugfixes:


Features:
- Now with three (3) runtime information tabs:
  1. Log (as before)
  2. Processing, updated every 1 second, with res / no. spots charts, Wilson
     B-factor histogram, and the hkl plot
  3. Analysis, updated every 30 seconds, with unit cell histograms, clustering
     results and basic PRIME results (i.e. only initial merging)
- Processing and analysis charts are only updated when tab is active to speed up
 the UI
- Runtime clustering and PRIME runs on a separate thread so as not to lock up
the UI
- Analysis tab can be toggled to not even show using a toolbar button
- Removed "invert boolean mask" option; now mask inversion only used when
necessary (i.e. if using Labelit-based backend), and not when using DIALS
- Added "flip beamXY" option; is necessary in a few cases, and will need to be
turned on only if images are not properly cropped / padded for Labelit. Since
Labelit is mostly deprecated, I don't anticipate there being a need to make this
 option smarter
- Moved Interceptor calculations to separate thread; UI thread for plots only
- Adjusted Analyzer's cluster info handling with new consensus SG lookup


Known issues:
- UI remains really slow when using XDisplay
- Clustering reporting needs touch-up in IOTA log file
