IOTA v1.1.014 - point picker and minor tweaks

1. Save text file w/ spotfinding results at every timer event in tracker
2. "Restore" function in tracker (works only with previous run results)
3. Live "point picker" in IOTA:
    a. Click on any point on the "Resolution" or "Strong reflections" chart
    b. Name of file will pop up, viewer can be used to see it
    c. Can advance up and down to view files before and after the pick
    (useful for dense point distribution)
