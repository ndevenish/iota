IOTA v1.1.004 - More bugfixes and GUI changes

1. Added a column to input box that shows how many images are read in
2. Input box columns now automatically resized when added
3. Moved image object polling to separate thread, so GUI does not lock up
during runs with lots of images (> 3000).



TO DO:

1. Wild-card processing results in a list, which makes IOTA confused. Resolve.

2. Clustering now works for DIALS output, but barfs (causes boost error) for
some reason.

3. IOTA Xterm INIT doesn't seem to interpret image types as well as the GUI.
Implement that, or it is behind.

4. XTerm version also fails to understand some of the new options.

5. Figure out why IOTA GUI is so slow when processing large datasets
    a. is it the graphics?
    b. is it the filesystem examination? -> yes it is! Two solutions:
       - poll filesystem on a separate thread so as not to lock down GUI
       - save intermediate image objects on /tmp. Retain only if wanted (w/
       DIALS, won't be wanted, so make an option in Preferences) and then
       move to processed folder.
