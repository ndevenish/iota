IOTA v1.1.016 - reindexing bug in IOTA-DIALS

1. This bug would crop up when dials.algorithms.indexing.symmetry
.refined_settings_factory_from_refined_triclinic would fail due to
insufficient Bragg peaks for refinement. There would be no solutions
returned, but the crystal information would be changed to whatever symmetry
was current while refined. Fixed it by deep-copying out crystal info prior to
 lattice refinement and reinstating this copy if refinement failed.
