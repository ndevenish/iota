IOTA v1.1.024 - image tracker upgrade

1. New interface allows image selection on chart (shift-drag: user can highlight
 a stretch of chart, the image list is then populated with filenames and the
 images can be viewed)
2. Click-drag allows user to select a range of chart to view close-up; slider
 then appears that allows user to navigate along the X-axis (updated as the
 chart is updated)
3. Quit finally works fast, doesn't cycle through all queued images
4. Chart update on each completed spot-finding instance, not timer (NOT sure
 that's the best thing...)
