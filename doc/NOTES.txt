IOTA v1.1.029 - GUI updates

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a few minor bugs in command-line argument read-in for GUI


Features:
- Clustering analysis: tried to speed it up; generated clusters from in-memory
  python objects instead of directing at the pickle files. So far, a small
  improvement for a 300-image dataset (~ 35% faster)
- Sped up run recovery:
    - A new file (analysis.pickle) output into run folder, with summary info
    - This speeds up recovery of complete runs by a lot
    - Removed redundant calculations for the beamXY plot, twice as fast now
- User-run clustering at end of run
    - Can re-run clustering many times with varying options
    - New options for clustering:
        - cluster_n_images - can set a random sample size for huge datasets
        - cluster_limit - limit for size of cluster that's displayed / saved
        - cluster_write_files - can choose to output (or not) clusters to files
