IOTA v1.1.021 - tracker streamlined interface

1. Reorganized image tracker to have just the chart and the image list
visible (spotfinding params in separate dialog)
2. Created new iota_tracker.py module to house all the tracking GUI elements;
 iota_track_images.py merely launches the GUI, etc.
3. List control allows selection of multiple images; toolbar view button
launches viewer with all the images selected
4. Virtual list control - faster updating. (Not sure this is working as
intended, though)
