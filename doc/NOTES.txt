IOTA v1.0.001P - bug fixes

Bug Fixes
1. __init__.py now included in all sub-folders; modules called properly
2. Visualization fixed and works as should (scipy dependencies removed completely)

Known Issues:

1. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
2. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that this is woefully inadequate
