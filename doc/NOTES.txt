IOTA v1.0.010 - GUI updates

1. Cosmetic tweaks to the multiprocessing preferences dialog
2. Reworked the "Processing options" dialog; users can now directly import
and edit the full PHIL file or generate defaults.
3. Processing options dialog can now be resized to accommodate PHIL text.
4. Some tweaks to the DIALS option of IOTA:
   a. Still doesn't work very well; need better defaults
   b. Failed images no longer register as successfully processed in GUI
   c. Fixed errors associated with calling settings that no longer exist
