IOTA v1.2.011 - streamlined processor

Bugfixes:
  - InputFinder will now return a folder type as "image" even if images in that
    folder are outnumbered by non-image files

Changes:
  - deprecated HA14 backend - may still check if it works on xfel builds
  - new input handling (with backward compatibility)
    - moved backend settings to separate PHILs in backend modules
    - image conversion for HA14 to its own top bracket and renamed to 'image
      import'
    - removed triage for HA14; grid search will be fully gone (never used) and
      minimum Bragg peaks now an option in general import
    - moved "flip XY" from Advanced to HA14 import
    - moved 'estimate gain' from Advanced to general import
    - moved UI options to separate PHIL in iota_ui_base
    - made backend-specific options dialogs for Import and Analysis
    - PHILFixer now handles all old scripts
    - UI updates for new PHIL and HA14 deprecation
      - Custom submission scripts added to IOTA Prefs
      - Moved all widgets to reflect their new positions in PHIL hierarchy
      - Created a more general PHIL import procedure for XTerm and GUI
      - moved n_processors widget to IOTA Prefs; streamlined main window
      - put in a couple of message dialogs that pop up when important things
      change (e.g. command string, or backend)
  - Custom submission scripts enabled (say, for submission to mp queues)
  - Removed iota_bulletproof.py from command_line folder
