IOTA v1.2.013 - streamlined processing

- Single command-line processing script (iota.run), which is less confusing
- Simplified input interpretation and pre-processing
    - removed init class (including base class and iota_ui_init.py)
    - single set of init functions: lighter, more efficient, easier to use
    - util to interpret mixed input (i.e. paramfiles, input files, etc.)
- Improved subclassing and instantiation of stills processor
    - abandoned Integrator class altogether
    - calling IOTAImageProcessor directly (subclassed from dials.stills_process)
    - created an import/processing wrapper factory for relatively
      straightforward adaptation to various processing needs
- Fewer imports and reduced probability of circular imports
- Improved processing info storage
    - abandoned INIT object and ANALYSIS object altogether
    - new INFO object with containers for stats, lists of files, and a few
      methods, but no heavy objects
    - INFO object saved in JSON format, not pickled (lighter and faster)
- Reduced the use of heavy objects
    - lists of objects replaced by consumable iterators
    - modules changed to run through an iterator once and never need it again
- A bunch of various UI improvements
    - replaced repetitive command-line print-in-place statements with a general
      context manager
    - "silent mode" to run without any stdout altogether (for UI and other
      purposes)
    - removed iota_ui_init.py; UI will initialize via generic functions
    - removed most calculations from main UI thread, for improved responsiveness
    - greatly improved responsiveness of clickable plots (redraw happens very
      quickly now)
    - added a "Crystal System" filter (for very coarse checking of integration
     results, e.g. if they are all in a tetragonal point group)
