IOTA v1.1.004 - More bugfixes and GUI changes

1. Added a column to input box that shows how many images are read in
2. Input box columns now automatically resized when added
3. Moved image object polling to separate thread, so GUI does not lock up
during runs with lots of images (> 3000).
4. Fixed a bug where multiple input entries failed to process
5. With DIALS, intermediate pickles saved into correct image object folder
6. Bad files (i.e. various txt, jpg, hidden files, etc.) generate objects
now, but are bypassed in processing
