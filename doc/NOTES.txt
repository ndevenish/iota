IOTA v1.1.031 - HKL slice viewer

Bugfixes:
- Spin Control: checkbox actually shown as checked if parameter is set to True
in the read-in PHIL settings

Features:
- The HKL slice viewer (a part of "charts" tab) can now be set to show the
general completeness for any space / point group
- The chart tab has been reorganized for potential insertion of other widgets
for each of the chart panels; this has the side effect of improving the
presentation of the HKL slice viewer.
- IOTA Properties: user can supply a range of images, or several ranges, e.g.
"5-100, 200-1000, 1234, 1500-1550"; random subset can also be taken from these
ranges, if enabled
