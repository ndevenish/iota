IOTA v1.4.006 - UI tweaks and debugging

1. Bugfixes:
    - Fixed default marking in PHIL panels
    - Fixed IOTA Summary window crash
    - Fixed PRIME run folder path bug
    - Added pre-set sizing to PRIME main window
    - Made image_viewer parameter not optional

2. Tweaks
    - Added options for Auto and None values of ints and floats
    - Added multi-value controls for strings, ints, and floats
    - Added a tribool control (though seems unnecessary and isn't working that
      well)
