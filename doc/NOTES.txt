IOTA v1.0.001G - GUI version

New Features
1. Basic GUI - run by simply issuing "iota" in command line
    a. Generated using wxPython package included with libtbx
    b. Identical functionality to command-line IOTA
    c. Can import / export scripts by and for command-line IOTA
    d. Spiffy progress bar

Known Issues:
1. Still a little dodgy when running IOTA with DIALS; will be improved in future
2. A more informative output is in the works (now just log text)
3. Still testing all possible usage, might have other bugs
4. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
5. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that this is woefully inadequate
