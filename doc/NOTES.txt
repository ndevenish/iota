IOTA v1.4.004 - UI updates and bugfixes

1. Converted PRIME UI to PHIL-based controls
    - had to amend some PRIME code to make sure that it coped with a couple of
      changes in the PRIME PHIL (e.g. str types changed to space_group, etc.)
    - updated PRIME controls to reflect improvements in IOTA

2. IOTA UI bugfixes
    - Recovery dialog now actually cancels when Cancel is pressed
    - Reset works after run recovery
    - Added exempt controls to reset (and also preserving them when initializing
      or resetting PHIL), which the GUI modifies to fit environment
