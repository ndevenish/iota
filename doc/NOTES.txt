IOTA v1.1.031 - HKL slice viewer

Bugfixes:
- Spin Control: checkbox actually shown as checked if parameter is set to True
in the read-in PHIL settings
- Fixed recovery of run w/o results
- Fixed BeamXY adjustment for DIALS (changed beamX and beamY to int)
- Double-clicking on summary chart works again
- Correct summary displayed in recovered run

Features:
- The HKL slice viewer (a part of "charts" tab) can now be set to show the
general completeness for any space / point group
- The chart tab has been reorganized for potential insertion of other widgets
for each of the chart panels; this has the side effect of improving the
presentation of the HKL slice viewer.
- IOTA Properties: user can supply a range of images, or several ranges, e.g.
"5-100, 200-1000, 1234, 1500-1550"; random subset can also be taken from these
ranges, if enabled
- Sped up HKL slice viewer by a factor of ~5
- Changed defaults:
  - DIALS is the default backend
  - Gain estimate turned off by default
  - Auto-threshold turned off by default
  - Use FFT3D turned on by default
