IOTA v1.1.027 - MOSFLM indexing in image tracker

Bugfixes:



Features:

1. Image tracker: Hooked up MOSFLM spotfinding / indexing, with space group and
unit cell reporting. Not *fully* ready in terms of interface, but works well
2. IOTA: Sped up filesystem polling for processed objects by only looking for
object files generated later than the last one plotted


Known issues:

1. Image tracker: interface could use to be faster w/ large datasets
