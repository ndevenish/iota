IOTA v1.4.016 - image view shows processing results

Features:
- Instead of just the image, individual image view from processing also shows
  integration shoeboxes; user can then view other results (e.g orientation
  vector, centers of mass, indexed spots positions, ice rings, etc.)

Known issues:
- This does not (yet) work for images viewed by double-clicking the progress bar
- This also works poorly with HDF5 images: for some reason loading the .expt
  file shows the *first* image in the sequence, regardless of which of the
  images the .expt file is derived from.
