IOTA v1.0.006 - New GUI features

Bug Fixes:
1. Can now run in selection-only mode (cctbx.xfel only) w/o errors

New Features
1. Rearranged iota_analysis.py module for use with GUI
2. Added "Analysis" page in output window that pops up at end of run
    a. Summary information
    b. Displays relevant graphs
    c. Button to run PRIME
3. PRIME GUI now exists; can run either from IOTA front window, from IOTA
analysis tab or by itself by calling "prime" in command line

Known Issues:
1. Still a little dodgy when running IOTA with DIALS; will be improved in future
2. Unit cell clustering currently not active; removing scipy dependencies
3. Because of this, median unit cell parameters returned; we are aware that
this is woefully inadequate
4. Sometimes (rarely) hangs when importing a script and changing processing
options - trying to reproduce
