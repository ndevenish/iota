Bugfixes:
  - XTerm IOTA now reports number of images that failed filter (was blank)

Changes:
  - easy_run submit for local MP jobs (less UI blocking)
  - moved base classes to iota_utils.py (base ctrl classes in iota_controls.py)
  - removed iota_cmd.py; using dials/util/command_line.py instead
  - renamed UI files for controls, dialogs, frames, and init
