IOTA v1.1.011 - Real-time diffraction monitor

1. Quick / easy monitor of incoming images (run as iota.track_images, may
change in future or incorporate into main IOTA module)
2. Performs basic spotfinding w/ DIALS and plots results
3. User can
    a. Introduce custom spotfinding params on start of run
    b. Change min Bragg spots requirement on the fly (graphic adjusted to show)
    c. Will have other capabilities in future
4. Tinkered with axis objects to make plotting much faster than normal
5. Virtually real-time with sufficient cores available for multiprocessing;
already there for 10Hz fixed-target / synchrotron experiments.
6. (needs more testing, though)
