IOTA v1.0.014 - Bringing back clustering; bugfixes

Bugfixes:

1. Fixed GUI crash on some Linux systems
2. Command line "integrate_with" selection is propagated without error in Auto
Mode


Features:

1. "Full processing" mode on XTerm IOTA: will process one image per core, top
 to bottom, rather than splitting import and indexing / integration. (GUI
 already does this.)
2. PRIME now has a "resolution override" checkbox in Advanced Options; this
box sets all resolution values to whatever the user enters into the
"Resolution" boxes. Otherwise, user has to modify resolutions in the script.
3. Re-introduced unit cell clustering (works only on installations with SciPy
 for now, automatically off by default)
